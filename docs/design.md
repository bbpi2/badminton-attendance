## Design Requirements

- The application must be a responsive web app usable on both mobile and desktop browsers.
- Players must experience a frictionless interface—similar in simplicity to a Google Form.
- Admin dashboard must clearly display attendees with quick-edit options for +1s and attendance toggles.
- Navigation should be minimal: ideally two main pages—`/attendance` and `/admin`.
- Authentication should be minimal for MVP (shared password gating `/admin`).
- UI updates should feel instantaneous—leveraging optimistic rendering with background syncs.
- All UI text should use a casual, human tone (e.g., “Bringing a friend?” instead of “+1 count”).
